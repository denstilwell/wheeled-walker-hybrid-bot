It is fun to imagine driving a bot in those dark forbidden
areas such as covered pipes, crawl spaces, attics and anywhere the imagination
takes you.  Add a camera and explore, inspect
and discover.  My project for The Hackaday
Prize 2017, The Inspectorbot, was great fun to build, plus I learned a lot
about controlling a robot through WIFI with a webpage and live streaming
multiple cameras in near real time.  I
also learned that those crawl spaces are bumpy.  In this year’s project, I plan to build a four
wheel drive robot with four legs that will fold out for walking in rough
terrain.  Hopefully the new bot will be
able to take a bot in the crawl space and beyond.  Wheels are easy to control and fast but are
not so good on rough terrain.  Legs are
great for rough terrain, but require a lot of motors and a feedback system to
know what position the leg is in, if the leg is touching the ground, and with
how much force.  Along with a lot of
motors is the need for a lot of motor drivers.  If the bot has six legs, it can use static
balance with three legs on the ground at all times.  I want to use a four legged design so I need
to develop a dynamic balance system which will require an accelerometer/gyro
chip.  The main controller will be a
Raspberry Pi with a camera that will blue tooth to a special motor drive board
I plan to build as another project.  Control will be through a WIFI connection with
a webpage.  And just for fun, I plan to
make the Raspberry PI camera module detachable to allow the “head” to be placed
on different bot bodies.  I love sci-fi
inspiration!  The project will also be
fully open source.
